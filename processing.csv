Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Melyanti Liando,5.0,"I stayed in this hotel Twice. The first was on 9-10 January 2022 and the second was on 28-30 July 2022. Room is spacious, got 2 beds. Breakfast is delicious, many variation of food. The gym facilities is good, the equipment is complete and clean. The meeting room is good The lobby also very cozy. Want to back here soon...."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,F Paul,5.0,"We enjoyed our stay here. The room is not as big as some 5 stars hotels in Java but it's very comfortable. The only difficulty I had was trying to adjust the room air conditioning. Swimming pool is nice but the breakfast buffet by the pool takes the cake. There are so many options, including Semarang specialties. I wish I could try everything! Food were laid out well and staff were accommodating."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Cynthia Isabella,5.0,"Two months ago, I stayed at Tentrem Hotel Semarang with my family. When we first arrived, we were immediately greeted by the bellboy, who also carried our suitcases. Then, at check-in time, we were served quickly, so we didn't have to wait too long, and after that, we were escorted immediately to our room. At night, we ordered food at the hotel via the telephone. It didn't take a long time for the food to arrive in our room. The next morning, when I had breakfast at the hotel, the waiters there greeted me with a friendly greeting and immediately escorted us to an empty seat. Then, the waiter also offered coffee or tea, and it was brought directly to our table. During our 4 days there, we were served in a professional and friendly manner. Their professionalism and great service made us want to go back there."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Karel K. Himawan,5.0,"The hotel that gives you a one of a kind experience! Unlike most 5-stars hotels, you can experience their authenticity in every corner of the hotel. They provide jamu and other traditional drinks in the mini bar. Semarang authentic food were provided in breakfast. Location is strategically located quite close to the heart of the city, but far enough to avoid hustle bustle of the city."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Francois Barbe,5.0,"First class service in a first class way. A real five stars hotel with all the amenities you dream of. Beds are soft, we sleep great. Staff at the pool or the restaurant is very helpful and friendly. A super memory for all our family.Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Winny Rachmani,5.0,"Our stay at Hotel Tentrem was the best decision. The room is excellent. Bed is spacious (for 2 adults and 2 children). I love the view from our room (It's the iconic swimming pool). Breakfast is amazing, especially if you are into local's food."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Amelia,5.0,"One of the newest hotel in Semarang. A luxury hotel with traditional touch throughout, classy, elegant with characters. Staff are friendly and attentive. Great breakfast selections as they include many traditional semarang + Javanese foods. We will be back for sure."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Indra Nafi,5.0,"It was one of luxurious hotels in Semarang which offered the guests with convenient services. The location was strategic, the room was comfortable and super completed, and it's equipped with a shopping mall and an apartment. The breakfast menus are tasteful. Everyone enjoyed their meals, including special menus from local semarang food and beverage. However, the price for a night was a bit expensive because it made sense with the quality of service. Thank you."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,ony,4.0,"Hotel lobby is luxury, big as five star hotel standard. They prepare welcome drink. We should wait 20 minutes to get the room key after check in. Average size room for that price, I think the room is smaller compare to other five star hotel in Jakarta or Yogja with same price. Toilet amenities are complete. Breakfast food menus and taste are standar. This hotel connected to Tentrem mall. So you can easy find food or cafe for lunch or dinner."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Riska Mordiana,5.0,"Great room, amazing lobby, wide variations in breakfast (western, eastern, original Semarang foods, pastries and... Ice cream!).

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Firman Adi Prayogo,5.0,"Just one word, Amazing! My first stay at Tentrem Hotel was going very well as I have event there. The receptionist, Saskia (if I am not mistaken) gave me early check in and best room view ever (1709) if you prefer high floor. Furthermore, the breakfast is absolutely one thing that you have to enjoy! As they offer plenty variety of food and also famous Semarang street food. It is magic! Last, I appreciate Saskia when I did check out. She greets me with my name even before I gave my key card. I am truly honoured to stay at Tentrem Hotel Semarang. That is one thing that I never get at any hotel before. Fully recommend to stay here!"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,lukianto wibowo,5.0,"Service are totally good. Food and beverage are awsome. Parking, pool and other facilities are great. City view are great as well. This is recomended and one of the best in Semarang. Can't wait to feel the same experience on Tentrem Jogja"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Bobby Wibisono Wijaya,5.0,"I would like to recommend this place. The room was nice with all of the complementary of mini bar that free of charges. And what i really love is the breakfast staff at resto kayu manis specially zainal. Well most of the food contain sugar. I did mention to him about my diabetic issue and he really ask me about what kind of food i have to avoid, and ask the kitchen prepare it for me. Shout out to Zainal for taking care of me."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,I love Food,4.0,"The rooms are spacious, clean, and very pretty. Although some of the paintings dod freak me out. Staff were very friendly. What stood out to me most is the breakfast! They had a variety of cuisine from all across the globe, and also local Semarang food. It was the highlight of my stay. For the pool, meh. It felt very awkward swimming in front of people having breakfast. There's no seperation fence/plants, so people could easily come in and out of the breakfast place to the pool. The outdoor breakfast area and the pool is so uncomfortably close. But it's alright. The beautiful tile art in the pool made up for it. The water felt very fresh and nice, didn't feel oddly chemical ish like some pools do. It's across Tentrem mall and very near citraland so you have a variety of food choices near walking distance. There's lots of local street food near the hotel too. My stay at Tentrem Jogja was a 5/5 but I would give Tentrem Semarang a 4/5."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Samuel Lumentut,4.0,"This is the most expensive hotel in Semarang. One group with Hotel Tentrem Jogja and Hotel Chanti not far from Hotel Tentrem Semarang. Own by Sido Muncul, the company who produces the world famous Tolak Angin brand. So where to start? Is it luxurious? You bet, service? Excellent, location? Almost all Semarang legendary foods are located within 15 to 20 minutes drive from the hotel which is Godsend. Breakfast? Although the international menus were a bit boring, they have stalls of more than 10 legendary Semarang food like Nasi Ayam Bu Pini, Gudeg Abimanyu, Asem Asem Koh Lim and many other. Oh don't forget to try their tolak angin ice cream. Its... Well ice cream with tolak angin taste... Literally. Its weird at first but its good the more you eat it. Pool also really great. Not too big but on 1 side they have transparent acrylic so it is so unique and cool to take photo at. The hotel is also connected directly to Tentrem mall. Upscale mall with not so many tenants but they have Ice Skating and cinema inside. They also have big aquarium with Arapaima fish native from Amazon river. Its great really. Alfamart is also like 25 steps away literally from hotel lobby should you want to buy water to stock into your room. Just perfect. So why 4 stars? Well.. Room is okay, aircon is cold. Bathroom also okay although the room that I stayed have no bathup. They have electric window that can be transparent or iced so you can't see inside. Pretty cool. The drapes are all provided by Serba Antik. The lifts also very high tech and basically has no button inside them. You push it outside the elevator where you wanna go. Very cool. They also give free minibar stocked with Sido Muncul products for you to try. So again why 4 stars? At this price I think the room should be a bit bigger, have bathup and fully carpeted. Granted they use some kind of marbles or Granite for the flooring, but for me personally plush carpet still make me feel like I'm in a 5 stars hotel instead of marbles or granite. The floor is cold to the touch always. If you use carpet it should be warm when you wanna just sit on the floor. Okay enough ranting. I'm kinda nitpicking over here. This hotel is not bad by any means. Might be the best in Semarang too, but well I'm not easily giving 5 stars anywhere. So this place should merit 4.5 stars for me. A great experience all in all... You should at least try once when you go to Semarang."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Andrieas Nanda,5.0,"The BEST hotel in Semarang. The Location near simpang 5 (best for street food) easy access to nearby famous local food. Complete facility for children and parent, large glass view swimming pool, playground, gym, jacuzzi, sauna. Forgot something? Don't worry Access to tentrem mall is as easy as walking around your home. FnB the best breakfast and dinner you can get in semarang"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Maya,5.0,"Impressed with Tentrem Hotel Yogyakarta, so we chose this hotel to stay while in Semarang. We stayed in not long after it’s opening in 2020. I loved the feeling when entering the Lobby, smell of Lemongrass was very comforting. In the corner you can found a cute Sido Muncul Cart displaying herbs drinks of Indonesia. The room is quite big. We slept in The double twin bed room. The bed is large enough to sleep one adult and one children. So if you’re a family with 2 small children, this room is perfectly fit! In the morning, breakfast was really really impressive yet surprising too. Literally, you don’t have to hustle round the city to have culinary experience. All the famous dishes in Semarang can be found here! From Nasi Ayam Bu Pini, Lumpia Semarang, Asem Asem Koh Lim, Soto Semarang, Wedang Kacang, es Marem etc. Can’t wait to have staycation again in this hotel someday"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Handoko Limaho,5.0,"Truly the best Hotel in Semarang…when we were staying here with our family, the hotel was fully booked and we end up in the smoking room. However the management tries to remedy the situation by installing our room with ionizer and room purifier to disperse the scents. The facilities are amazing and especially the breakfast are to die for. We can get all the authentic Semarang food over here. Truly a must place to stay in Semarang"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Bryant Matthew Potro,5.0,"Great room, great services, great breakfast, its a good place to stay, but please revise your managing breakfast flow to avoid crowdingRooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 4/5Hotel highlights Luxury, High-tech …More"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Martinus,3.0,"Stayed at the hotel during max occupancy i think. Lines were long, waiting time were also long, request got overlooked. basically they should be working much more efficiently at high load, because Tentrem bears the title best hotel in SMG. However room service is great, food quality was great. Breakfast selection also great. Pool bar service, Health center, Kids area also maintained great service."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Tiffany,5.0,"The first thing you'll notice when you enter the hotel is the unique smell, you can smell ginger in the air in almost every area of the hotel. The room is pretty big and clean. They provide many choices and variations on breakfast. The staff are friendly and helpful. They sure are quite expensive, but it's equal to the quality and service they provide"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,George Hadipoespito,4.0,"Great luxury hotel located in the heart of Semarang. Breakfast is the highlight: the restaurant serves samples of famous local heritage restaurants, it’s almost a complete Semarang culinary trip in one sitting. Unfortunately during this stay, service was a little slow: we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a staff to unlock the connecting doors between our two rooms."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,chandra amelia,5.0,"Tentrem Hotel never disappoint. Endless choices of breakfast buffet (ok, not endless, but they do have a vast array of breakfast delicacies), professional and friendly staffs (not to mention fast response too), and their pool is a must-see! Their gym opens until 11pm. Oh this one is also family friendly, the kids club is quite big and definitely entertaining."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Kiki Pratiwi,5.0,"I love my stay here. The staff are so friendly and very helpful. The ambience so lovely , combine between Javanese and Tionghoa. Love their breakfast variation menu. Will definitely stay there again when visit to Semarang."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Freddy Samad,5.0,"Superb hotel as it should carrying the name Tentrem. Room is fabulous and spacious, made with top notch material like mable bathroom and high thread count sheets. The window between the bathroom and the room is electronically dimmable by a flick of switch, I know smart glass existed for quite a while but it's still fancy nonetheless. Soundproof of the room is great, toilet is spotless, shower drainage works fast; everything as it should be. Breakfast is buffet type and has everything from continental to local Semarang delicacies and everything in between, even ice cream if you fancy your early dessert. Their barrister is also very good with their coffee creations, I love both their hot and cold coffees. They also has a great juice bar, sometimes making a acidic delight detox concoction. I highly recommend the breakfast as your stay package. Hotel facilities are also great, swimming pool looks good and there's a direct access to the small mall. Is it expensive? Yes. Would I return? Absolutely."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Veronica Gunawan,5.0,"I could easily give 10 stars for this hotel! Wonderful 5 Star hotel with all of Semarang's iconic cuisines under one roof! I asked one of the chefs there. Apparently the hotel aims to provide local cuisines by buying them directly from the local vendors, so guests don't have to venture out in the heat to taste the local cuisines. Brilliant! It's also strategically located right at the city centre so it's very convenient and easy to get to other places like gift shops, restaurants, Lawang Sewu and Kota Lama. The staff were all so curteous, helpful and friendly, they make you feel at home right away. Even though we stayed during the high season when the hotel is fully booked, it's still easy to get help from the staff. Normally it would be very hard to get anything if the hotel is fully booked, but not here. I also fell in love with the peranakan-themed decor throughout the hotel, and the beautiful paintings they have there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and can't wait to go back and stay there again."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Yuniati Wibowo,5.0,Good place to stay when you're in Semarang. The service is very good. The staffs are kind and helpfull. Breakfast is superb. Surely will be back to stay in Hotel Tentrem again when when we go to Semarang👍👍👍Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Riza Satria,2.0,"Service not as good as Tentrem Jogja.. especially breakfast service, staffs were not paying attention to who's first in queue, chaos inside the breakfast area, very low helping attitude among staffs to guests (helping open door, seating arrangements, cutting fruits, etc)..

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Amrina Rosyada,5.0,"Stayed for 2 nights and 2 days with my husband, we had a large room, clean and sufficient equipment. We had a great 'sahur' with variety menu from local and western food. The taste was good and fresh. This hotel is located next to the tentrem mall where you can find your needs or just killing your time. However, there was a kind of renovation infront of the hotel that made us uncomfortable for waiting outside the hotel main entrance. Though, this hotel deserves the 5 stars for the hospitality of the staffs, the well-managed & clean room, and delicious food."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Faela Sufa,5.0,"Arguably the best 5-star hotel in Semarang now. I love Tentrem’s chain. Breakfast selection is great, I love the fact that they serve getuk & plenty traditional food 😍"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Linna,5.0,"It was my first time to stay in this hotel. I love the ambience and the design. I enjoyed the pool and the jacuzzi so much. The gym was also not bad. I just have an unpleasant experience during our check in. We booked 5 rooms in the same floor, and when we arrived from 6 hours drive at 2 p.m the rooms wasn't ready yet. We told them again we want all rooms in a row and they said it's no problem. At 3 p.m the staff told us only two rooms ready and we need to wait for few minutes for the other 3 rooms because we wanted it in a row so we decided to give the two rooms to our parents so they can rest. I said but the check in time is 3 p.m. She said it's because there was only two cleaning services in one floor. I just don't understand how can that be our problem but I just let it go. Few minutes later I heard the staff who serve us told her friend to tell other staff that the rooms was booked by us and to not give it to other guest. And few minutes from that the staff told us that we can't get the room in a row. And if we want to get a room in a same floor, we need to wait another half an hour. I was dissapointed because I know they probably gave our booked room to another guest after we stand waiting for more than an hour but we were all tired for the long drive and we didn't get our room yet so we decided to have some rest in the two rooms while waiting for the other rooms to be ready and the staff promised us to deliver the other rooms key to our room at 16.15. But we waited and nobody came and we need to call them again before they finally come and give us the rest of the room keys. When I get to my room, I saw yellow stain in our closet. It was easily removed by wet tissue, but it was gross and I just don't think it should happen. I think the room service was in a hurry to prepare the room. So yeah the hotel is very nice, they just need to improve the service, especially the front desk and cleaning service. I still give them a five star because I really like the hotel and hope it was just a one time mistake, they will improve and it won't happen again to anyone."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Max Suswendi,5.0,Tentrem has set as the one the best local luxury hotel chain in Indonesia. I have stayed in both of their property in Jogja and here in Semarang. The quality of Service and the Hospitaly are excellence. All their staff are friendly and helpful. The Rooms are beautiful and well decorated with good combination of traditional and modern theme. The Breakfast is one of the main reason to stay in this hotel. It is the best breakfast buffet that I ever had particulaly the local traditional food. Don’t forget to try their Roti Kukus. It is a perfect companion for a cup of black coffee. Definitely will stay again in this hotel if visiting Semarang.

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Imam Kurniawan,4.0,"One nice hotel in Semarang, strategic location, side by side with the mall. New and clean. Friendly service. For the price offered now it is still not in accordance with the room facilities. The parking lot also fused with the mall parking, somewhat difficult, especially when the mall was crowded with visitors. The Touch Screen access lift is not suitable for current pandemic conditions. But overall this hotel is good and worth for visit"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Tia Rosmananingrum,5.0,"Modern yet maintain the Central Java traditional value. Cozy and the room is spacious. Food delicious. Located in central Semarang so there are street food vendors nearby. Of course, with all that reason the room rate is pricey but worth it"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,navjit Singh,5.0,"I stayed here during my visit in 2022. It's good hotel, apparently, the best in Semarang, as i heard. What was good here is, 1). There interiors in the lobby are awesome. There chandelier, the painting while u go to the elevators is amazingly real. You just can't walk towards elevators without noticing it. Amazing artist 2). The elevators are pretty protected and clean with tochless tech during covid times. 3). Regarding Rooms, the interior was amazing, nice curtains, carpets. They even have a pillow menu to choose from. Memory foams and all needed. Bed quality was good. Although I do feel, they can add a duvet to the bed, to add the grace to the room. 4). Restaurant is on 6th floor with indoor and pool side seating. They have good menu. Staff of hotel was courteous and helpful. Enjoyed my stay. Stay blessed, god bless! Regards #NaviWanderer"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,P S D,5.0,"This is a great hotel to stay if you are in Semarang City. Great room, service and friendly staff. Attentive is the key. Booked 3 executive rooms on the 19th floor which is also the executive lounge floor. Easy access. Breakfast menu changed from day to day. The only minus point is that they don't have a separated or dedicated parking space for hotel guest."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Indra Dani,5.0,"My First time staying at Tentrem hotel in Semarang. Seems to be a modern hotel in Semarang: modern elevator with smart touch screen and smart glass technology in the bathroom. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable. The hotel staff are really very friendly, polite and always ready to help. My experience in the pool, the staff is very helpful and provide accurate information. All the staff are very professional from security, receiptionist, cleaning service. For the breakfast menu, the food is very typical of Semarang, varied and delicious. The check-in check-out process is very fast, I really like it. Very recommended hotel in Semarang....."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Sarah R.,5.0,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Great interior, very clean. Everything is brand new. Mini bar is free and some other interesting freebies (say, Tolak Angin) that I like about staying at Tentrem property. Food was just so so, they can definitely improve. Decent coffee served at breakfast. Some of receptionists weren’t too responsive at times, I remember during checkout I had to call the front desk twice to ask for someone at the concierge to fetch my luggage, which was kinda irritating when you’re staying at a 5 star hotel, why was the phone unattended? Also what was irritating me the most was when I first arrived (Around 1.30 PM-ish) one receptionist told me I could not get in until 3 PM. Was tired from my flight and that was indeed a turn off. Luckily they found a room quickly, so that was forgiven. All the guys at the concierge were quick & attentive though. PS: This hotel is very crowded and busy these days, packed with family mostly, not recommended if you hate slow things or if you are a business traveller longing for quietness."

They took (not remake) some of the most famous local dishes to breakfast menu, such as soto bokoran, nasi goreng babat, and asem-asem koh Liem.

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,martinus krisma,1.0,"- Arrived 15 Jan around 3.15pm. Requested high floor but given 8th floor. Then moved to 12th floor only after i requested for it. Check in time was unpleasant. Took more than 20 mins. This is too long. - welcome letters for executive suites are personalized / directed to customers name, disappointingly i had some else’s name addressed to me in that letter. Such a shame. - travelled with fam n 3 y.o kid, breakfast staff did not permit us to enter bfast bcos we were wearing pajamas! Asked all of us to go back up to our room to change clothes, in a very INPOLITE WAY!!!. In fact we were wearing pajamas with collar and trousers, others wearing tshirt n shorts with slippers were allowed to go in. Not sure why is this rule even be there?? Havent seen this in any other hotels. - we know executive suite isnt YOUR most expensive room BUT Certainly its enough reason for us to expect personalized services n details to be served to us perfectly is it not? I would be glad to hear some response from you. Please do take notes. And improve."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Joselin,1.0,"Have stayed here a couple of times and it has always been a good experience to stay at Tentrem until today. Apparently their staff, mba Zakiya, didn't respect the culture of queuing so she'd allowed group of people to cut the line even when people had queue outside for a long time. When confronted, she gave excuses, lied and was not even apologetic at all. Thank you Mba Zakiya for showing the true hospitality of Tentrem. The ethics of not queueing, lying to customers and condoning bad behaviors of unruly customers are very well imprinted on my memory of your hotel."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Benita Selian,5.0,"Spacious room with great interior Modern elevator & smart glass in the bathroom Huge pool Clean gym and jacuzzi area Artistic overall hotel design Love the jamu selection in the hotel The hotel smells really good too On top of all, BEST BUFFET BREAKFAST my family and I ever had!!

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Kevin Antonputra,1.0,This is the review of the breakfast service I had in Tentrem Hotel on Tuesday Morning. I’ve stayed at Tentrem a couple of times and breakfast is somewhat never perfect but today I had enough. I was in queue for breakfast as per Tentrem’s regulation and there were 2 groups who were cutting the line and the staff did nothing about it. It was frustating because the line is quite long and I complained to the staff (name: zakiya) as why the man was allowed to cut the line so effortlessly. So it’s very frustrating and today we learned that Tentrem doesn’t require people to queue because that’s not their “hospitality regulation” or their business ethics.
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Jeffry Lukito,5.0,Bed is supercomfy.Breakfast is wonderful. Always get the breakfast buffet. Always.
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Darmawan Darmawan,3.0,"Some positive. Great location, very nice friendly staff, great room, pool is amazing and also very kids friendly. The negatives which is quite big is the logistics of elevator and parking. Took forever to wait for elevator. There was a wedding and almost all of them are full. Parking lot was not properly organize with the traffic flow. No special lot for hotel guest mean that guests have to compete with mall attendant for space. I hope they sort all this out before grand opening. I visit during partial Covid Lockdown. The hotel did not limit capacity on breakfast dining room so its quite crowded and risky. So this is a big drawback."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Andrew Santoso (Andrew),5.0,"Premium location near simpang lima and connect with tentrem mall, unfortunately tentrem mall still not many tenant open For parking, you can use ticket or e-money. It is more efficient to use e money, because it can registered to receptionist so you dont need to stamp your parking ticket everytime. A lot of parking area and its clean because using epoxy floor. For entering the hotel area, the security will check your body temp and baggage At lobby, i check in at 12 PM. Lobby is so wide and the ceiling height is so high. Luxury and ellegant with chinese malaysian interior style complete with artwork adding the art value to the hotel. Many seating area at the bar and near lift. I book 2 rooms, the first is already ready when im check in, the second room ready at 12.30 PM which are nice due to 2PM check in time. The lifts using tap card system and we will allocated to one lift. My rooms completed with towel art. And in a short of time, staff give us slice cake. Tiramisu strawberry cake with soft texture and yummy taste. The room is modern and spacious with chinese peranakan interior with bright colour and mix combination bronze glass. Partition bedroom with bathroom using smart glass, but in my room, its broken. For the flooring, they use marmer with rugs below the bed. Bathroom equipped with washtafel, shower and closet. There is no bathtub in the standard room The room is equipped with armchair and ottoman, big working desk and aergonomis working chair. The TV use 49 inch with IPTV system. King size bed 200x200 equipped with 3 firm pillow, 3 soft pillow and 1 small pillow. Pencil note, iron and iron board, laundry bag, slipper and additional small bolster are in the wardrobe There is 4 mineral water 600 ml and free minibar (floridina, coca cola, kuku bima energi and teh botol). For coffee, they prepared tana mera, sidomuncul ginger coffee. Tea using tong tji and dilmah brand. They also prepared sidomuncul produt like kunyit asam and tolak angin Pool and gym located at 6th floor. The gym equipments are complete, but due to pandemic the gym is limited to 6 people only. There is jaccuzzi and sauna. The pool is so wide with glass wall and mermaid mozaic for the floor so it will be photogenic. There is 4 gazebo and pool bar too. Tentrem semarang is full occupancy at that day, so for breakfasr we queue, but the staff responses are very fast so we only queue for 10 minute. The menu are so many variant, the taste also tasty and delicious. Here the outlet list at tentrem 1. Live cooking corner (sushi, yoghurt, meatball noodle, cheese chocolate bread, soto bokoran, dan fresh juice) 2. Bakery pastry and dessert (traditional jamu, croissant, waffle, pancake, sweet bread, lupis dan cenil, slice fruit watermelon, pineapple, melon, papaya, vanilla ice cream, chocolate, strawberry, tolak angin, es krim teppan, and croffle, es campur, wedang kacang koah, wedang tahua, handmade local coffee) 3.

Very unfortunate for such a nice hotel. Had to wait for 30 min just to go down to lobby because they have the same lift access for hotel guests and wedding guests. No distancing in the dining room, no one really guarding the lift where there are wedding attendees just wanted to cram in the lift with 6 people. This hotel has top notch equipment but not the know- how. We wanted to get more privacy by booking nice hotel but we were grossly mistaken I also just noticed the guest greeter guy had his mask down and rubbed his nose. Long check in procees also. We ordered 2 rooms but one unit was ready 20 menits early and one was ready 30 min after. Ifyou wanna stay here, stay during weekdays only."

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Vincent Wongso,4.0,"always drive through this hotel and try to spend a night here after 4 nights in ciputra surabaya + surprisingly clean and such a shame for competitor across that looks clean outside but dirty inside + location is just awesome + bathtub but there is an issue + good noise insulation from next door + linked to the shopping mall (not one but two) + tons of food and attractions outside + smart tv is a nice addition + proper fridge + nice view from the room (if you pick simpang lima view) + staff are really helpful and fast check in process. they are even still helpful even after i checked out and i asked for invoice. thanks a lot for Shinta!! + simpang lima is just awesome + tons of delicious food if you walk a bit. - its smells old and feels old - the basement parking is a disaster - going into the building is very difficult thanks to the online taxi driver - the building spotlight pointed straight to my eyes and its difficult to see outside. instead of see simpang lima, i ended up saw the spotlight. luckily they turned it off after 9pm - bathtub are pretty useless, knob are broken - can't control the temperature - would be nice to put some reflective window tint way better than i expected to be honest, but it doesn't fit me and i prefer to slept somewhere else next time."

The parking space is small and many car wait at the lobby that cause to traffic."
Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Tom Hietaharju,1.0,Very old hotel with a lot of erosion. Smoking is allowed inside so everywhere smells like old cigarrettes. In rooms full carpet floor was extremely dusty and smelly. Same with curtains. Toilet seat was leaking. Very noisy also. Easily can hear other rooms. Very average breakfast. Some food served cold even join early time breakfast. Only good thing is fast acces to the mall from the lobby. Very expensive for all it's offerings and overall quality. Cannot really recommend in any aspect. Our first and last stay in that hotel.

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Ajie Isdianto,3.0,"Pretty good for an old building. But be aware that the online booking service provides no options to choose between smoking or non-smoking room, you have to make the optional request probably by phone or e-mail. Because I checked-in late at night, they don't have a non-smoking room available, I had to stay for a night in a smoking room that doesn't have exhaust system nor windows that can be opened. Thankfully the problem resolved in the next morning."

The hotel remains as a gem in central Semarang, situated just across Simpang Lima and directly connected to Mall Ciputra. Our spacious room was on the tenth floor with the Executive Lounge located just next to the lift corridor. Plenty of choices of breakfast, although the restaurant itself is actually quite small. The pool is located on the 4th floor but I did not try it out"

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Avissa Suseno,4.0,"Been staying at this hotel for about 4 nights. It's 5 stars hotel that's opposite to Simpang Lima. It was quite a good experience since they provided us with the daily welcome drink that was Beer Plethok (Traditional beverage) at the lobby and you can take it as much as you wanted. They also provided you with toiletries everyday, kettle, coffee and tea bag, cup and glass. Unfortunately the shower wasn't as heavy as we expected and also the room wasn't opposite to Simpang Lima. This hotel also can help you to access to the Citraland Mall from the lobby since they have door that can lead you to the mall straight away. You don't have to pay for deposit, that's good."

I have stayed at the hotel on and off for 5-6 years now and I have enjoyed the company of various staff members. The two that come to mind most often is a breakfast waiter named Risty who is a bit portly but nevertheless the most helpful. His attention to details is respectful. On occasion, I also meet one of the managers named Han. He looks dapper in his suit and tie. I have tried a few newer hotels, but nothing seems to beat the Ciputra."

Breakfast is amazing. 5 different types of Breakfast types from Western to Asian , Chinese....Service is great.

We will be back there again if we go back to have family holiday in Semarang for sure"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,joko muslim,2.0,"This hotel has advantage in location, however the services need to be improved. As hotel with 5 stars, the reception staffs are lack of initiative to serve and hospitality also need to be improved. The air conditioning in the room can’t be controlled which I felt too chilling. Breakfast is the only best part of this hotel with fast responses staffs. Foods are good and various from western to local. The room are clean with electric water boiler. Complementary mineral drinks were plenty with several tea bags, instant coffee, creamer and sugar. Facilities operate at during daytime and close early, not really suitable for those whose finish work at night. When I arrived at the hotel with motor cycle Gojek, we are not allowed to stop at the main entrance, this felt discriminated.😓😓😓 I did stay there eventually."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Marolop Pardede,3.0,"first time staying at this hotel, the lobby looks clean, smells good, the lighting is good. going up to the room floor, getting out of the elevator was greeted by a musty smell, the smell of damp. my room the impression is also not pleasant. smelly pillow, shower can't be rotated. for a 5-star hotel, the breakfast menu is below my expectations. maybe this will be the first and last experience staying here."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Jessica Natania,5.0,"Great place to stay. The room is spacious and the bathroom as well. Breakfast is good, a lot of variants included the famous lumpia semarang, nasi goreng babat, babat gongso, and soto semarang. Tried those foods earlier from the famous stall, but Gumaya’s is way better. One thing that’s slightly missing for me is their service. In breakfast time, they didn’t help to find table (the situation is crowded and I almost didn’t get a table) or even offer tea/coffee as it’s the most default service they should have. But overall, it was a pleasant stay which I would definitely pay another visit."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Wee Lee GOH,4.0,Services were super good from front desk and the gate counter. I think previously other people complain and they made big improvement. Enable to speak good English is a plus! I am impressed that they call me up for any comments and help I need. Gate counter help to ensure my grab was well received. Superb! The breakfast is famous which later I heard from my supplier. It offer full range of traditional Central Java food. Indeed is traditional with intestine food provide.However I can not appreciate the traditional Kueh which is too hard for me. I book delux king room. The room is huge but look really old to me. I thought they just renovated. They provide total 6 bottles mineral water which I greatly appreciated What could be better if the swimming pool can close at later time like 9pm would be great.

It would be perfect if they served ice cream. Service was awesome. Of course there was a certain lady that took care of room checking during breakfast that sometimes got on your nerves... I drove my own car, and parking was nice. The basement was kinda tight for big SUVs. The rooms were very good. Smells so nice. AC was cold and comfy. The beds need replacement soon because it bent so much when you woke up in the morning. Bathroom was perfect👍👍👍. Would definitely come back here 😍"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Arvin Tanu,5.0,This is NOBLE COURT review. A restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the hotel. I really loves this small chinese resto. Taste very good and their menu are different from regular chinese resto. I tried their fried thousand year egg. It was great. Then their xiaolungbao. Their skin was too soft. But tasted very good as well. Their price is not that expensive as well. Very affordable. Overall such an underrated place.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,farida rokhmawati,3.0,"Great location Hotel, Good Food but Disappointed by the hospitality of the receptionist This hotel is located near a lot of shopping center. The room was clean, spacious and the food from the restaurant quite good. After our check out, I asked politely a favor to one the receptionist to take a picture of us on the lobby as a souvenir and she looked weirdly at me then said “a moment”. Her expression made me upset then I asked to a waiter that was in front of the restaurant to help me and that waiter with a big smile took a picture of us. So I would like to say thank you so much for that waiter and please give some hospitality training to that receptionist. If she was not available or maybe don’t want to help, she can try at least to control her expression in front of the guest."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Miranti Rachmatsaleh,2.0,"Room is spacious but very disappointed with the hotel management. No crowd control during breakfast ended up with long queue, and no options to bring the food to the room. Breakfast area is very crowded which left lots of concern about safety during covid time. They hotel is putting up safety measure like spraying your shoes before entering hotel premises (which is good) but not putting up safety measures at the breakfast hour which left a bigger concern."

And for water lovers, this hotel provides 6 bottles of 600mL mineral water every day as a complement. Our second day at Gumaya Tower, I got a call from Yessy, the hotel staff, who asked if there were any problems we experienced during our stay. For us, this attention is extraordinary.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Derk Wolters,1.0,"We booked a suite for one weekend. Found the suite clean but outdated. Uncomfortable furniture, very limited coffee and tea facility and no minibar. Food that was served in restaurant downstairs was covered with plastic. And whilst we were eating they were already setting tables for the breakfast. Very noisy. Food in skylounge was also not good steak I ordered was cold and the food we ordered cam out not all together but in two servings. For the amount of money I pay for one night , over 4 million idr, it is certainly not worth it. Found the staff not interested with the guests. Not once we were asked if everything was OK. Even at the checking out the receptionist didn't even ask how our stay was and if we enjoyed staying in their hotel. Will not be going back for sure, there are much better hotels to stay in semarang and for a much better and fairer price."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Cliff Gerardo,5.0,"Lovely hotel, well, it SHOULD be as Semarang’s best 5 star hotel. Got checked-in quickly, trip to my room was fast and efficient because of their 4 elevators. My room was pretty clean. Carpets are not though, but I can still get by it. They provide a lot of amenities in the bathroom which is always a great thing. Bath tub was clean too. Let’s not forget beds. They have the comfiest beds I’d argue. Staff since I walked through the door were very helpful and friendly If I do say so myself. Although the Cascade restaurant was closed for renovations during my visit. I still enjoyed the food they served in the Polaris Room 3rd floor. Pool and Gym was great! 5 stars from me!"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Tania Pratiwi,3.0,"For the room very clean and comfortable, the amenities are complete. Loved it. The only one that bothers me is breakfast time. Cause the ballroom and one of the restaurants is under maintaining, so the breakfast move to 3rd floor and it's a really small capacity and easy to full, so we are directed to 2nd floor, their backup place for breakfast. The foods have not many variants just like the 3rd floor, and the staff is careless and there is no clear signage where when the elevator is open. Really disappointed 🙁"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Raditya Bagoes,3.0,Tolerable place for a 5 star hotel. The room was spacious and the bathroom was great. But there was a coffee stain in the table. I dont bother with the stain but for a 5 star hotel it was questionable. The food also just okay. We order nasi goreng babat for dinner and nothing special. At breakfast they give me ramen with udon noodles. When i ask for chilli flakes they give me sambal from bakso? How come you mix ramen and sambal bakso. Lol.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Halim Ashari,3.0,Poor hotel SOP. They have very friendly and polite staffs but because the SOP is somewhat muddled they look bad. We ask for an extra bed and we were asked to pay first before they can send the bed. We have already lodged our credit card as payment guarantee. That's not 5 star service. My first experience when staying at this so call 5 star hotel.

Room was spacious, 6 bottles of mineral water (2 were cold in the mini fridge!). Water kettle was almost broken but still functional on my second stay. Room and the hotel was very clean, hand sanitizer easy to access. Felt very safe here during pandemic. The bottom of our shoes were sprayed upon arrival. During breakfast service, staff can be seen actively helping guests and cleaning up. Food was awesome. Ordered oxtail soup and macncheese to our room and they came fast, very tasty (did not taste like ""hotel food"" but more like home cooking, even the bfast food too!). Thanks so kuch Gumaya Tower hotel, can't wait to stay there again!"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Saiful Anam,5.0,"After 2 years, I am back here. It looks more luxury after being renovated. Far different and improved. The breakfast was also so good.

The swimming pool, spa and fitness were great and the food taste very good too !"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Aris B Nugroho,4.0,"The spacious room with friendly design and staff has made us feel at home.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Bobby Sumarkho,4.0,Pleasant hotel in the heart of Semarang. The room quite spacious with cozy design & tone. It's quiet & well maintained. Bed & pillows comfortable. Bathroom has both shower & bathtub. I notice pool did not provide towels so some children walked into hotel wetting the floor & elevator.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Agatha Claudia,5.0,"Location : very strategic, within walking distance to some famous culinary destination Room : no complaint, very spacious, bathroom clean spacious, bed are comfy, amenities everything fit the description of 5 star hotel. Service is great, fast. They have many facilities, swimming pool but not too wide, fitness center with spa and sauna, they also provide shoes in case you use sandals. Price compare to Jakarta, ofc it's very affordable , if you visit Semarang and you wanted to stay in an affordable 5 star hotel, this is it"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,my TaRaka,5.0,"Realy amazed with the details. They arranged a diferent tile in the bathroom, unslipery for the shower room, comfort bathtub, lots of mineral water to drink (they gave 6 bottles). They even put the information on the lamps buttons, so I dont have to klick it many times, guessing which button for wich lamps. The room is cozy, bright and spacious. The hospitality is great. Food are amazing, lots of choises and it taste good. Gym and the pool were quite good. Surely will coming back here."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Tomi Satryatomo,5.0,"One of the best places to stay in Semarang, especially if you need to be close to the downtown area. Only take a few minutes to walk to the famous Simpang Lima, the iconic roundabout considered as the center of Semarang, with the mystical Lawang Sewu (a thousand doors) building on one of the sides. The room is neatly arranged, the bed is comfortable, the breakfast is nice and the service is superb. Everything you could expect from a 5 stars hotel. The only downside is the swimming pool which length is only about 5 meters. Due to the pandemic, the hotel implements strict regulations. Mask is expected to be worn at all times. In the restaurant, you're not allowed to take the food by yourself. Someone is always ready to cater to your need. Tables and chairs are put at a distance."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Binod Ojha,5.0,"Nice hotel with the good services by hotel staff. Easy to reach mall and food. A lots of variety food in the breakfast but it more to local food which is not really international buffet. They serve buffet for the dinner on Friday and Saturday with reasonable price and delicious. So you should try it. The problem is only to go to GF Lobby, you have to change 2 lift the reach there."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,rasta chok,5.0,"Spacious room. Clean. For 5 star hotels if possible replace tea bags that are a little classy. There is no hairdryer in the bathroom. The breakfast menu is varied, delicious, coffee uses a machine so you can ask for cappuccino etc. Recommended 👍"

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Sahala Harahap,5.0,"Nice and clean room, good selection of menu on breakfast buffet, attentive service. They provide free 6 bottles of mineral water in the room (usually only 2). Be careful when order room service though! I ordered oxtail fried rice, only to find I can't eat it because it's too sweet, and too oily."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Ika Hapsari,5.0,"The most luxurious hotel in Semarang city. Located in a very strategic area in Gajahmada street that is super accessible from the city center. I haven't try to stay here, only try their iftar menu in their ballroom. They provide such a complete menu for iftar with understandable price. No wonder that this hotel has 5 stars label. Like any other city style hotel, they don't have a wide area of courtyard that make it a bit crowded when there is an event inside attended by many guests. The interior design is also modern and luxurious. The room rate is fair according to the season"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,David Teck Chin,5.0,A high end hotel within the sleepy city of Semarang. I enjoyed my stay here and the value for money for the quality of the rooms was good. The staff were attentive and their restaurants were pretty good. Buffet was really cheap and offered a fair amount of choice from various cuisines. Location is near the famous weekend night market which houses a huge number of stalls for street food within their little chinatown. It is also near Paragon Mall. Overall can't fault much for the price of the rooms at which I got mine for.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Bruce Hanadi,4.0,"This hotel is located near downtown, only 5 minutes drive to the alun-alun simpang 5 or lawang sewu area.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Prasetyo Utomo,5.0,"New hotel, clean and spacious.. Good price/rate, free breakfast"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Chris Gsb,4.0,Nice and cozy
Gumaya Tower Hotel,D K,2.0,"Seems do not deserve to be called a 5 star hotel. The facilities and attention to detail does not reflect a true 5 star hotel. See pictures for reference. The worst part of it all...hairdryer cable blew when my wife was using it. It sparked some fire with smoke while tripping the circuit breaker. My wife's finger got burned and she felt a little numb on her affected hand. Hairdryer has no brand, look and feels cheap! Hotel apologized, and sent a small cake as a sign of apology. I think this hotel still got potential to better. My room pros are, cold air con, quite comfy bed, ,,, 6 free bottle water everyday..."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Gagah Gautama,5.0,"Good at all, especially for the many choices of breakfast and it all was very delicious. Clean room and all facilities, but the swimming pool just standard maybe because it's not a brand new hotel. Overall satisfied and would come back again"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Catur Wibowo,5.0,"This hotel is excellent. It was my first experience of staying in this hotel, and I have a great experience. From arrival, checking in till departure, all are great. Thanks"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,buyung mahendra,5.0,"This is a five star hotel in semarang. The room is big enough and standard facility. But there are a bathtub in every room i guess. Because of covid, you actually can eat every dish in the restaurant but cant serve your selve. No problem cause every dish is tasty."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Andy Wijaya,5.0,"Going to bukber event at Marquess. My favorite so far is chicken quesadillas, beef wellington, balinese grilled fish, chicken satay, and their sushi is also nice. I never found a delicious sushi in an all you can eat scenery. My last praise goes to their mendoan / fried tempeh. Very crisp and salty makes me reach for it for the 2nd time 😅"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Jess Lam,5.0,"Location is in center of town though no shopping mall in walking distance. However, with the availability of grab taxis in the city, there is no transportation problem at all to visiting the big malls in town. Big room, spacious bathroom and great breakfast, although a little crowded during the Muslim Holidays week. I love this place."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Lumi Loo,3.0,"Decent size rooms for a 5 star hotel outside the capital. Prices are fine, BEWARE that the hotel only assigns ONE floor for smokers. Receptionist claims that you've to call ahead and confirm, yet my room was denied to me even after a verbal confirmation of availability. There was no upgrades or compensation offered, but the hotel moved us to a smoking room the next day. They've also managed to lose a charger of mine during the room transfer. If you insist on a local experience, go for it, but this hotel won't be my first choice on the list. I've had better experience with other hotels in the area. (Crowne was a significantly better experience, not sure about its current state after they changed management to PO hotels.)"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,George Adriaansz,4.0,"This new hotel might be the best among other hotels in Semarang city. The building was new, the front desk staffs are friendly and responsive, there were four lifts to serve the hotel guest uo and down, the breakfast room was spacious and offered various menus to satisfy our taste buds. The room was spacious, well furnished, and amenities were complete and good. No restaurants surround this hotel that could reach walkable, so the guests had two options to have dinner, go to hotel restaurant or go to other redtaurants by taxi or on line rental vehicle"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Agus Eko Priyono,5.0,"what can i say.. it is really a superb hotel.. very good location, you can go to various tourism objects at Kota Lama Semarang.. quite well equipped and the modern concept, it is very good.. the room is comfortanle, of course.. great lounge area, and the staff is very nice too.."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Helipat 13,3.0,This is not a 5 star hotel . Very poor executive lounge coke or bier with 5 cake. Room are nice but AIr con to cold and not adjustable. Breakfast not super nice ( western food not keeping warm) So for me .... Not a five star international hotel . Maybe 5 stars Indonesian hôtel 😎 I will not go back
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Ferry N. Langelo,1.0,"The first time after so many years and dozens of times staying here I felt cheated by the Gumaya Hotel sales. Before booking, my office person asked for the type of room and they provided information that the grand deluxe room was more spacious than the standard and got free access to the executive longue including breakfast but the room price was around 30% more expensive. I chose the room because of the facilities they mentioned and I got room 1618 but it turned out that the room was as large as a standard room and what was more painful when I wanted to have breakfast on the executive longue I was greeted by a female officer there stating that since the pandemic they only provide cereal, coffee and tea in executive longue so if there is nothing and it is not different from the standard room why am I not informed before buying a room which is 30% more expensive without more facilities??? Is this a hotel sales tactic or a management policy fooling its customers???"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Nikita Shelomentsev,5.0,"Pretty clean and spacious. Breakfast less ideal for European food lovers, but still you can find something to eat. Has good gym, pool and ok sauna"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Steven Kester Yuwono,5.0,"Excellent hotel in Semarang. spacious room, good location, 8 mins walk away to semarang town square and Paragon mall. I am very impressed by the gym located at level 3. There is a swimming pool and golf Drive range next to the gym. We can borrow towels in the gym. Sauna and steam room available in the gym changing room. However sadly today both sauna and steam broke down."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,ViE Vie,5.0,"Spacious room and great location - walking distance from some of culinary spots such as Loenpia Mbak Lien and Tahu Pong. The room is spotless and the bed is comfortable. The staffs are friendly. Amenities are good and various breakfast menu. Indoor parkir lot which has direct access to the hotel lobby is limited, but it doesn't matter since they have spacious outdoor parkir lot. Just pray it doesn't rain when you park there, no roof to shelter you from the rain."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Handoko Kwan,5.0,"One of the best hotel in Semarang. Room is spacious, breakfast is good and delicious."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Deorita Edsonia,1.0,"The staff attitude was so bad it covers up my experience staying here. The staff who was serving us didn't even say welcome at the first place. And after making us wait for around 1 hour (turns out he was too busy assigning newly arriving guests), he wouldn't even look us in the eyes when he's setting up the room key. In summary, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ hotels with ⭐ service"

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Laras Rahayu,5.0,"I didn't know that there is a five-star hotel in Semarang. It was great to stay here for 2 days. They have a large enough bathub and large mirorr on the foyer area. The rug are soft enough so if you stay with toodler, it's safe enough for them. The plug in the room can be used for both Indonesian, US, & Japan type. Since I have a device bought in Japan, I did not have to worry when charging my device. The staff service are very nice too and don't forget the various traditional herb drink ""jamu"" you can have during breakfast time! I also had a dinner in the Skyline (a skydining restaurant). They provides various food and drink."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Crowned Pillar,4.0,"At the entry of the parking lot, theres a van mounting goods that we hv to wait for them to finish, before we can enter. Smells of tobacco during entry to lobby n toward coffee shop. As we ask for non-smoking room, the waiter is reluctant to point to the restaurant, because we hv stated we only want cake n coffee. So she asked permission first n told us we can sit at the restaurant. As i asked for the rest room, they point me to the second floor, n i cant use the elevator, but the escalator. As we leave, we noticed people are smoking in the restaurant, n smell it too. Seems like poor designing."
PO HOtel Semarang,Luthfi Pradipta,3.0,"Actually, it was not a very bad experience, but considering the 5 stars status this property had, I set my expectation quite high for my stay here. The building was not well maintained, it was shown with some ceiling leakages in some areas, including in my room. The hot shower was not hot enough, so there’s no use to have a tub in the bathroom. The room decoration seemed pretty outdated. However, it’s fair enough to appreciate the strategic location of this hotel."

PO HOtel Semarang,Raymond Valiant Ruritan,4.0,My stay went well. I enjoyed the acces and service of the hotel. This hotel is just atop the Paragon mall. The ambience and environment is also nice. I enjoyed my stay albeit it was short. The staff was helpful and the service is acceptable. One area of improvement is the buffet breakfast. I kindly suggest to put more attention at the CoVid-19 protocol implementation. Service staff must use handgloves and masks all the time. Visitors are required to obey the rules within the restaurant.
PO HOtel Semarang,Manoj Bhat,4.0,The hotel is a very nice place to stay in Semarang but the parking is really a problem for those who drive in. One of the worst driving lanes for parking I have seen in my life. In fact the wall and divider is so full of paint from bruises that cars before mine seem to have created a crazy graffiti that you will find hard to avoid contributing to.. A sad situation to have for a property so prime..

Room was old, poor maintenance, stains all over carpets, sofa, mold on the corner. Bathroom design is wrong in so many level IMO, poor design, poor execution Carpets in all floor and room (10th floor) with stains all over, and not really recommended if you have asthma or allergy. Not sure if it is because of pandemic thingy, but this hotel needs a lot of improvement to do. Such a waste of money"
PO HOtel Semarang,Cat tseng,3.0,"Old hotel badly maintained. Pictures on the web do not serve as accurate depictions. Upon arriving on our floor the 10th floor, when the lift doors open the first thing we note is the condition of the ceiling right smack in our face. The ceiling had dark brown mould on it and parts of the ceiling had broke also. The carpet had an old moudly stench. Lift to rooms has room key scanner but not in use so anyone can come up to the rooms even non hotel guests. Why would they install a card scanner if it wasn't being used? Carpet in the corridor and rooms look worn out. Edges of bathtub have rusty edges. Tap at the sink is tough to even turn on the water. Stains on bedsheets,sofa and carpet. Bathmat, towels, face towels are actually tattered at the edges. How can the hotel still use the ammenities? No hand towels were available also. Towels look worn and greyish white. They had stains on them. Hotel did not provide glasses or cups at the bathroom for brushing teeth. Room seems to be dusty as my son's allergy acted up. Water pressure's strong except it was so hard to work the tap at the sink. Shower in the bathroom is bad. Water trickles not shower. Hot water was minimal. Yellow mould was all over the sides of the edges. Rusty cracked parts of the hand shower area had sharp parts. Very dangerous for children. Such a pity this hotel is poorly maintained. Service standarda also fall far from 5 star standards. During breakfast time we witnessed the staff clearing up the breakfast buffet at 10 and none were wearing gloves. It seems all very unhygenic. Breakfast closes at 10 and we were the laat guests for breakfast. Every staff were busy clearing up the foods. So we have to be quick to get whatever breakfast we could. Ordering from the staff for even coffee was greeted by, "" this is the last one ya Ibu this is already 10am"". If only they could keep up the hotel's so called 4 or 5star standards this hotel could be a really good stay considering the location right next to the mall. Just one stay here is enough. Totally not worth the money paid for. We didn't bother to complain to the hotel too even though we are due to check out tomorrow considering all the complaints I've read online. It seems the hotel just apologizes but does not take action. Some past complaints were months ago. Please work very much harder to make the hotel a more welcoming place for guests. I wouldn't think we will be back again. Please be warned if you decide to stay in this hotel."

My room number is 1009. I have a local rain in my room. It's such a special bonus from tropical country's hotel, which is quite famous for its heavy rain weather. They said that my room has some leakage problem with the ac and they just act like it is a regular problem. This ridiculous thing supposed to be not happened in hotel that claim has 5 star. No body apologize as it is just regular problem. They just give a cold call and weird unsincere sorry from phone after i get angry to their engineer. Even they dont pay attention to my gender call after so many times i explain them to call me mr rather than mrs / madam. The worse thing is they even dont have in room dining service after 9.30 PM. This hotel is located in central java's capital city but i really feel that i stay in a secluded village with its natural rain. Their towels are even worse.

PO HOtel Semarang,Curious Fingers,4.0,"Only stayed 1 night before returning home. Check in took an hour because we ordered connecting rooms or at lease side-by-side rooms (confirmed) but at the time unavailable. For info, we checked in after 2.30 pm. After some pushing, the staff gave us upgraded rooms on 11th floor. The rooms were freezing, so the whole night we turned off all AC. TV wasn't interesting, internet also was barely there, so kids kept on using indosat, which had to be near window. View was excellent, esp at night. Staffs friendly. There's ironing board inside closet although we didn't use it, but surely would be handy when staying longer. Amenities weren't complete, we had to ask for towels and bathroom mat. No tea, no sandals, no pen and paper, and no lock in bathrooms. Bathtub-room door was sliding type, so my toddler couldn't play in tub without flooding the whole room. The good side, it had clothes line. There's shower and closet inside with regular glass doors. Sink was draining slow. I think the bed was too soft, but luckily it didn't cause backpain in the morning. Breakfast was... kids didn't eat much u know. Definitely won't stay again here. The plus was the hotel's right beside mall, so have fun exploring."

The carpet was soft but it had so much dust bunny build up. The TV connection was really poor. The toilet couldn't flush properly. We got to go to the club lounge but no one took us there so we had to find it by ourselves. Really not worth staying at the suite room. A normal standard room would have maybe been okay.

Hotel staffs are nice and helpful, but room service were clumsy. On the first day, they forgot to put shower gel, and on the second day they pick up our bath mat and put nothing as replacement. Other sad thing was the food. Breakfast and catering for meeting lunch can't be said good nor satisfying.

PO HOtel Semarang,Karina Dewi,4.0,"Obviously, it's befitting to it's newest 5 star hotel in town rating. The minuses : swimming pool too close to breakfast area , I guess if you don't mind being a show to other guests, this is not a problem. Also swimming pool amenities is quite disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Then against if you are there for business who cares. But I do hate it that they allow smoking in the pool area. What if kids are there? Also other minus is that the no single twin bed room, even though I know that this is the norm with a lot of girls these days, I still think as a business hotel it's a must. Another, is that the bathroom is annoying. Be it the configuration or the partition of the bathroom. For I prefer a proper wall and door to prevent cold air from coming in to the bathroom. I also prefer being able to poop behind a door that is not a glass, even though it is frosted. Breakfast food is good with a wide selection. Be it Southern food or European food I seen it here. Sadly the local herbal drink , jamu, is of poor quality because they sugar and water it down. Which I think is disappointing cause I'm all for advertising our Indonesian heritage. But oh well, economic crisis, what can you say. I also like it that you get 2 fluffy pillows. Yes, in my book this earn additional point. It's connected to a mall, though I'm not a big fan of malls, it is safe to say it's easy for food acquiring purposes. Another minus you ask? Ofc the b**** price! But hey if you ok with it it's worth checking the place while it still have that new tag."
PO HOtel Semarang,marsya sinta,3.0,"we didn't get non-smoking room even though we travelled with a child. The service are standard, unlike what i was expected. I wouldn't recommend guest with their own vehicle to sleep in this hotel. We arrived quite late and my dad have to park the car himself just to pay for valet service the next day. The service is that slow. The next day I found out we have to go to 6th floor to this ""special floor"" for hotel guest, turns out the floor is not only for hotel guest and are packed with the mall visitor. From the 6th floor we have to use the elevator to enter the hotel then change to another one to go to our floor. Good room, but Way too much effort for me."

PO HOtel Semarang,Michael Williams,1.0,"The smoking rooms are a health hazard, not regularly deep cleaned: As a non-smoking room wasn't available, we booked a smoking room thinking it would compare to other smoking rooms we had previously stayed in, with only a mild scent of tobacco. But stepping out of the elevator on the 9th floor there was already a strong smell of smoke. Inside the room it was overwhelming. Knowing how bad it was, they had placed a large portable air purifier in the room. This was comical as they could have added nine more and it would have had no effect. Instead, they should be regularly deep cleaning the carpet, drapes, upholstery, etc. which clearly they don't do. We spoke to the evening manager working on the 14th and asked for a non-smoking room which he refused to give without us paying an upgrade charge of an additional IDR 1,500,000 / $115. They know how bad these rooms are but still required us to pay. So we stayed in our original room and I woke up with a headache which I'm certain was caused by the air in the room. On a positive note, other than this, the rooms, pool, gym, and hotel overall are great. The staff are amazing. If you can get a non-smoking room, I'd recommend the hotel. But until they start regularly deep cleaning the smoking rooms, for your health I'd avoid those."

If you're a Westerner who likes to have their coffee refilled regularly, it's best to sit near the center where the coffee pot is (otherwise the staff will go get you a half-cup of fresh brew). Also, they call the pit if coffee ""Arabica"" so ask for that if you want a refill. The fitness center had TV's on the treadmills that didn't work for two weeks even though ""the technician was called.""

PO HOtel Semarang,Jyu Grâce,1.0,"Decidedly unpleasant. First the hôtel's lobby is located in the same drop line of a mall. Blared horns galore. It's just a noisy spectacle. Pinnacle of inconvenience comes when the plumbing is proved to be below anything decent. There is no hot water. All I have is lukewarm, if I am being nice, presque cold full bath. The shower just makes me feel ultra cold. Called concierge. 'It's under maintenance'. Cannae you just said that when I check-in? Give me a 'hi please do not fill the bath cause it's useless'??? Hot water is base necessities. Unbelievable."

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Meida Ardina,5.0,"The only thing I don't like is the air-conditioner was just too cold for certain rooms. Also they need to add variation of food, I think. The sales might need to check and re-check the details of the reservation. Especially the date. But well mistake happened, it's been taken care of. I'm glad the sales did everything she could to heed my request, from my organisation, which was excellent from their part. I really appreciated the sales's effort! The meeting room was also good, but I suggest they add a whiteboard. Because flipchart isn't wide enough and some people found it a bit hard to see, especially those who were at the back. Everything else were amazing. Please keep up the good work!"

Poolnis spacious and the officer do the job to welcome the guest prepare the rest chair and provide the bath.. well compare nowaday hotel that guest NEED to ask or visit the towel counter.. Santika bring the even simpe customer experience ahead. Check in/out is fast the concierge bring our belonging to. room. Parking is spacious and due the hotel location in city area is very good. Breakfast is modesty but they still serve/pick it for guest while other hotel may loosen the requirement but we can understand if this is hotel's way signature to maintain hygiene in 'pandemic loosen time' but pls review it as common guest hotel may prefer to choose its own food.

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,B. Jonathan T.,3.0,"Used to be a quite fancy hotel. The lobby still looks premium but the ceiling has been water damaged and looks deteriorating. Once you enter the room it feels as budgety as a budget hotel. Cool white lights make it feel a little cheap, no real mugs in the room only paper cups and cheap plastic cups in the bathroom. The floor used to be made of carpet and contrasted with ceramic, now replaced with regular ceramic tiles for the whole room, they removed the bath tub and replaced it with a shower only. They removed the wallpapers and painted the walls brownish white. Much more to rant about for my disappointment. Overall it is a good hotel but as a person who used to go here all the time this makes me very sad and disappointed, They gutted almost everything that makes me enjoy staying here. Definitely no longer a 4 star hotel in terms of room feel except for the spacious rooms. The service and food still remains excellent as always."

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Teguh Sunyoto,1.0,"At check in, we asked receptionist to store breast milk in their freezer (we also already wrote word ""freezer"" in the plastic milk container) as we plan for 2 nights stay. For the information, it was a 700ml breast milk that was pumped by my wife during our 4 days trip prior to arriving to this hotel. In fact, we have also asked this (whether the hotel can store breast milk in their freezer) via phone before we book the room, and they confirm providing the service for their guest. It turned out, at check out, the hotel staff did not store our breast milk in the freezer instead they store it in a chiller and as a result our breast milk spoiled and can no longer be used/given to our baby. All the hotel staffs did just say sorry without any explanation, they don't understand how much effort my wife have done to pump that breast milk during our trip. The above was not the only disappointing experiences we had in this hotel.. on the morning when we ready to go for breakfast the electricity suddenly turn off for almost 1 hour.. as a result we must go down to the restaurant from 6th floor using emergency stair. Btw, I have my parent (78 and 65 years old) with me and also a 3 month baby with its stroller. This was a terrible experiences for our family. We also have to eat our breakfast without light.

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Hardono arivianto,5.0,"It's been a while since my kidney transplant that i manage not to go out from my home town especially during this covid 19 pandemic, until sometimes this week i've to go to Semarang for official duty, no need to think directly i booked Santika, and what a surprised than when check in i've to declared my health status dan asked wether i've take the swab antigen recently which is THIS IS A GOOD think. Entering rooms, there is a pair of medical mask,a paper cup for coffee, plastic cup in bathroom which is according to me one of the anticipation during the pandemic When taking sahur i'm also experiencing a good example of safety precautions from Santika, still in buffet style but the Santika staff wearing hand gloves will get what want behind the stall, so no need to worry that other guest already touch the pan, tea pot and other. It is nice to be back to Santika Premiere Semarang"
